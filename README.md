# longvinter-modtools
Application to automatically install and handle updates of mods

Look forward to what's going to come:
  - Checksum of updates / installations of mods to prevent any corrupted files
  - Searchbar to look for available mods based on keywords
  - Protocols to handle modtools://args (Prob could be coupled with a way from servers to automatically download mods)
  - Handle issue where a mod repo is deleted so fetch json fails

Mods that uses resources (Like minimap which load maps from .png) needs some extrawork from creator to handle subfolders in CoreMods folder as mods files are contain in mod_name/mod_files.

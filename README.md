DISCONTINUED AS MODDING WAS NOT POSSIBLE ANYMORE AT SOME POINT AND LOST INTEREST IN THE PROJECT AFTERWARD

# longvinter-modtools
Application to automatically install and handle updates of mods

Look forward to what's going to come:
  - Searchbar to look for available mods based on keywords
  - Protocols to handle modtools://args (Prob could be coupled with a way from servers to automatically download mods)
  - Handle issue where a mod repo is deleted so fetch json fails
  - i18n

Mods that uses resources (Like minimap which load maps from .png) needs some extrawork from creator to handle subfolders in CoreMods folder as mods files are contain in mod_name/mod_files.

If you are a mod creator go check here : https://github.com/tsukasaroot/longvinter-mods

Also thanks to everyone that tested the software and gave me feedbacks on it!
